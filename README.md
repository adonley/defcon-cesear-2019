cesaer challange defcon

### Installation
```
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Usage
To solve the first challenge:
```
python3 main.py
```
This was base6 in groups of three. I transposed the card four times within this as well. I'm 
missing the CSV that we created that created a 2D array of the card.

To solve the second challenge:
```
python3 music_convert.py
```
This was all ascending notes were 1s and all descending notes were 0 from the phone line.
You can see some of the other things I was trying that didn't work out in `music.py`.

I don't have the solution to the third. These were 16 bit machine instuctions that were evaluated in
obfuscated javascript. Located here: `https://youreinvited.to/a/party/4.6692/`
